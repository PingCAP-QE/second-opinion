# PR review workflow (baseline)

## 0) Language

Apply shared language contract from `fragments/review-language-contract.md`.

## 1) Define scope for this round

Classify the round as one of:
- First review: no prior baseline in this session.
- Incremental review: new commits exist since the last reviewed baseline.
- Targeted verification: verify specific previously raised items only.

Default:
- If there is no prior baseline, treat it as **first review**.
- Otherwise treat it as **incremental review** and focus only on the diff since the baseline.

## 2) Collect minimal but sufficient evidence

- Prefer using user-provided artifacts (PR description, changed-files list, diffs) when available.
- For incremental reviews, restrict reading to:
  - the new diff since baseline
  - the touched files only
- Run targeted compilation/tests when feasible; avoid broad test runs unless requested.
- If a test in the target repository requires `--tags=intest`, use it.
- If verification requires enabling failpoints, ensure they are disabled afterward.

## 3) Review dimensions

Always check:
- Correctness: logic bugs, missing error handling, signature/contract mismatches, missing Close/Flush.
- Engineering risk: resource leaks (memory/goroutine/FD/connection/`resp.Body`), concurrency safety, unsafe defaults.
- Security: secret logging, unbounded reads/writes, unsafe IO/network behavior.

Conditionally check (when behavior/contract changes):
- Compatibility and boundaries: defaults, system variables/config, filesystem/object-store paths, HTTP behavior, upgrade/rollback impact.

Optional (non-blocking unless user requests):
- Performance: avoid unnecessary allocations/copies; avoid `io.ReadAll` when streaming is sufficient; avoid extra IO.

## 4) Produce review results

Write:
- `second_opinion.md`: a human-readable summary + prioritized list of issues.
- `second_opinion.json`: findings following the repo schema.

Write these files in the repository root. Printed chat findings do not satisfy
this output contract.

For each issue, include:
- what is wrong (one sentence),
- the concrete fix direction,
- how to verify (minimal reproducible commands when possible),
- and map "must fix" to severity (`high`/`critical` vs `low`/`medium`).

If GitHub posting is requested or confirmed, also prepare:
- `second_opinion_github_comments.json`: comment payload draft following `fragments/github-comment-contract.md`.

## 5) Posting decision gate

After producing `second_opinion.md` and `second_opinion.json`:
- If the initial user request explicitly asked for GitHub posting, proceed with posting flow.
- Otherwise ask whether the user wants posting and wait for explicit confirmation.

## 6) Side-effect boundary

Do not perform any GitHub operation with side effects unless explicitly instructed.
Do not add repository shell posting scripts for GitHub comments.
For actual posting, use `gh` CLI.
If `gh` is unavailable or unauthenticated, fail the posting step explicitly and stop.

# GitHub comment contract

Apply this contract only when the user asks to post review findings to GitHub,
or explicitly confirms posting after review outputs are complete.

## Output artifact

Write `second_opinion_github_comments.json` in the repository root as the posting payload plan.

Each comment entry should include:
- mode: `inline`, `file`, or `general`
- attribution line: `Source: <type>/<id> | [Second Opinion](https://github.com/PingCAP-QE/second-opinion)` as the final non-empty line

## Language and formatting

- Always use English in GitHub comments, regardless of review-output language.
- Keep comments concise, actionable, and tied to one finding each.
- Include what is wrong and the concrete fix direction.

## Anchoring

- Prefer modes in this order: `inline` > `file` > `general`.
- Use `inline` mode when the target line is diff-resolvable.
- Use `file` mode when file context is known but line anchoring is not reliable.
- Use `general` mode only when neither line nor file anchoring is possible.
- Do not duplicate one finding across multiple comment modes.
- When posting inline/file comments, do not add an extra review body comment per finding.

## Posting safety

- Do not add repository shell posting scripts for GitHub comments.
- For actual posting, use `gh` CLI when available.
- If `gh` is unavailable or not authenticated, fail the posting step explicitly and stop.
- Posting review comments requires PR context. Without a PR URL, fail posting explicitly and keep local outputs only.

## gh posting mapping

- `inline` mode: post PR review comment with `path`, `line`, and `side=RIGHT`.
- `file` mode: post PR review comment with `path` and `subject_type=file` (no line).
- `general` mode: use PR conversation comment only when neither inline nor file anchoring is possible.
- If inline posting fails with a line-resolution validation error, retry once as `file` mode before using `general`.
